 Youtube Video Downloader

A lightweight desktop application to download YouTube videos (Using youtubeexplode) swiftly and easily while also using ffmpeg to reduce fps if option is chosen.
Heavily usage of AI cuz i suck at this.

Will add: (attempt to) more features like a settings tab, funny bitrate crusher, custom fps values, remembering prefered resolutions/fps, download bar actually working, optimization, file size estimate, image reference, support for short form videos

Need to fix: Temp_Video file not actually deleting at the end, if 1080p doesnt exist it doesnt default to the highest fps, too many popups that have me needing to press ok (should add a little text box that shows these instead), autoatically download ffmpeg if application is downloaded, maybe upp application to 64x bit instead of 32x

If u want to assist me u can contact my discord (Caerot).
